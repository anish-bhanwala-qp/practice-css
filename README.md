### form wave animation

1. Use javascript to create span for each letter.
2. Use sibling combinator ( + ) to select letters instead of toggling class on the parent element.
3. Use translateY for transition instead of top (better performance).
4. Using :valid (input:valid) psuedo selector to prevent labels to overlap non-empty text input.
5. Use scale(0.98) easily add button hover affect (I used opacity).
